# Cement_Hydration_Temperature
Cement hydration is an exothermic process producing a heat increase at an early age of concrete. However, a high-fidelity prediction capturing its underlying physics has remained infeasible. In this work, an original physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture PINN-CHK is proposed, to investigate the early-age temperature rise in cement paste during the cement hydration kinetics. The main purpose of developing PINN-CHK is to enable a data-driven solution to the cement hydration temperature problem, under the impact of material properties and maturity function in fresh cement paste. In this regard, the developed PINN-CHK architecture is trained on a heated cement paste, by simultaneously fitting the hydration temperature experimental data and its underlying physics, to achieve a mesh-free simulation. Results show that PINN-CHK is better in convergence issues and higher in accuracy than conventional mechanistic methods. PINN-CHK is a novel approach to better understand the cement hydration kinetics in cementitious materials, and can be an attractive alternative to the traditional finite element solvers.

We provide:
1. A pseduo code of PINN-CHK to play with
2. An executable (.exe) file to run trained and saved model on any pc
