# Cement_Hydration_Temperature
Cement hydration is an exothermic process producing a heat increase at an early age of concrete. However, a high-fidelity prediction capturing its underlying physics has remained infeasible. In this work, an original physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture PINN-ET is proposed, to investigate the early-age temperature (ET) rise in cement paste during the hydration process. The main purpose of developing PINN-ET is to enable a data-driven solution to the cement hydration temperature problem, under the impact of material properties and maturity function in fresh cement paste. In this regard, the developed PINN-ET architecture is trained on a heated cement paste, by simultaneously fitting the hydration temperature experimental data and its underlying physics, to achieve a mesh-free simulation. Results show that PINN-ET is better in convergence issues and higher in accuracy than conventional mechanistic methods. PINN-ET is a novel approach to better understand the cement hydration kinetics in cementitious materials, and can be an attractive alternative to the traditional finite element solvers.
